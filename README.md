# unleash-bun-demo

Simple demo using [Unleash](https://www.getunleash.io/)'s [unleash-client-node](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-client-node) with [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

It checks the "enabled" and "variant" status of a local `unleash-bun-demo` toggle and prints the result to the console. If you'd like to test it, you should change the parameters accordingly.

Never heard of Unleash? Is is a feature management solution built with large enterprises in mind so you don't have to build one yourself. Open source, private, secure, and ready for the most complex setups out of the box.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.11. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
